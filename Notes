Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning (MobileNetV2 Model)

Dataset Used: PlantVillage (Kaggle)

Developed a deep learning-based system to automatically detect plant diseases from leaf images using the PlantVillage dataset. 
Implemented and trained CNN models to classify multiple disease categories with high accuracy, improving early detection and supporting smart agriculture solutions.

Collected, preprocessed, and augmented PlantVillage leaf images to build a high-quality training dataset for disease classification.

Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect plant leaf diseases, achieving 94%+ accuracy.

Applied techniques such as normalization, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.

Evaluated the model using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy metrics to ensure reliability.

Built a prediction pipeline to classify new leaf images and visualize outputs for real-time disease detection.

Documented model performance, experiment results, and training workflows for reproducibility.

Tech Stack - Python, TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn
